# -CyberSleuth---Student-Cybersecurity-Assistant
CyberSleuth is an AI-assisted cybersecurity CLI tool for students and educators. It performs quick reconnaissance of websites with tools like network scanning, phishing detection, WHOIS, header checks, and fingerprinting. This project aligns with the *Student Innovation* theme, promoting cybersecurity awareness and empowerment.

Instead of relying on cloud-based or one-click scanners, CyberSleuth merges real penetration testing tools like nmap, whois, mitmdump, etc., into a single CLI-based agent system — each one with its own task and report. It’s like having your own personal cybersecurity team that’s easy to understand, learn from, and expand.”

“It’s also modular — future agents can be added for things like SQL injection testing, DNS hijack detection, or Android app analysis.
